        As someone who has 8+ years of experience in the Hospitality industry,
        I've had many various service-based roles. I wanted a change in my life,
        so I decided to retake the Myers-Briggs personality test to see what
        types of roles I could be suitable for. One that caught my eye was Web
        Development / Software Engineering. I never knew the two could be so
        similar.

      <p className="py-5">
        Well, not that similar, really. At first, I jumped right in. I joined an
        intense 24-week Bootcamp, and as embarrassing as this is to say, I had
        no idea what I was getting myself into. HTML, CSS, great, fantastic I
        thought, I can do this! Then we got to JavaScript and I thought what (in
        the console.log('hello world')) is going on!? At the beginning of 2021,
        I no longer continued on that course. From there, I started
        self-teaching through Free Code Camp, Udemy, playing games like Grid
        Attack or solving kata on CodeWars, using any and every cheap/free
        resource I could find to practice and learn, especially in JavaScript,
        until in 2022, I was accepted as a Trainee in CodeYourFuture, in March
        2023 I graduated with a certification in Full Stack Web Development, and
        in April 2023 I accepted my first contract position as a Software
        Developer.

        I'm grateful that I didn't stop and I am grateful for the community I
        found through CodeYourFuture. Because now, two years later, I've
        rediscovered myself in the best of ways. I've learned how much I enjoy
        learning new things. I've learned how passionate I am about solving
        problems and helping others solve problems. I've gotten to know how
        great it is to be part of a development team, building solutions toward
        greater goals. I've rediscovered a fire, a drive, a vibrancy, but most
        importantly, I discovered a new and incredibly gratifying way to express
        my creativity; through service, solutions, and syntax.
